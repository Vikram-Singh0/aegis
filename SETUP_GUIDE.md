# Aegis Protocol - Setup Guide

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

I've identified and fixed several critical issues with the contract-UI wiring that were preventing loan transactions from reflecting in the UI:

### Issues Found:
1. **Missing Environment Variables** - No `.env.local` file with required Thirdweb client ID
2. **Transaction State Management** - UI wasn't refreshing after successful transactions
3. **Missing Event Listening** - No automatic data refresh after contract events
4. **Incomplete Contract ABI** - Missing important functions and events

### Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Created `.env.local` file with required environment variables
2. ✅ Added proper state management with refresh functions
3. ✅ Implemented automatic data refresh after transactions
4. ✅ Enhanced contract ABI with all necessary functions and events
5. ✅ Removed page reloads in favor of smooth data updates

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Get Thirdweb Client ID
1. Go to [thirdweb portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your client ID
4. Update `.env.local` file with your client ID:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
   ```

### 2. Deploy Contracts
```bash
cd aegis-contract
npm install
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network somnia
```

### 3. Update Contract Addresses
After deployment, update the contract addresses in `aegis/src/config/contracts.ts` with the deployed addresses.

### 4. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd aegis
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### Transaction Flow:
1. User initiates transaction (deposit/borrow/repay/withdraw)
2. Transaction is sent to contract
3. Upon success, UI automatically refreshes:
   - Account data (collateral, debt, health factor)
   - Token balances (WETH, USDC)
   - All calculations update in real-time

### Key Improvements:
- **No more page reloads** - Smooth data updates
- **Automatic refresh** - Data updates after every transaction
- **Better error handling** - Clear error messages
- **Real-time updates** - Data refreshes every 10 seconds
- **Enhanced ABI** - All contract functions available

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. Connect Wallet
- Click "Connect Wallet" on any page
- Select your preferred wallet

### 2. Deposit Collateral
- Go to `/borrow` page
- Enter amount of WETH to deposit
- Click "Deposit Collateral"
- Approve the transaction in your wallet
- **UI will automatically update** showing your new collateral

### 3. Borrow USDC
- After depositing collateral, click "Confirm Borrow"
- Enter amount of USDC to borrow
- Click "Confirm Borrow"
- Approve the transaction in your wallet
- **UI will automatically update** showing your new debt and updated health factor

### 4. Verify Updates
- Check that all values update immediately after transactions
- Health factor should recalculate
- Token balances should reflect changes
- Max borrow amount should update

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If transactions still don't reflect:
1. **Check console for errors** - Look for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify wallet connection** - Ensure wallet is properly connected
3. **Check network** - Make sure you're on the correct network (Somnia Testnet)
4. **Verify contract addresses** - Ensure addresses in config match deployed contracts
5. **Check gas fees** - Ensure you have enough ETH for gas

### Common Issues:
- **"No client ID provided"** - Update `.env.local` with your Thirdweb client ID
- **"Contract not deployed"** - Deploy contracts first
- **"Insufficient funds"** - Ensure you have test tokens
- **"Transaction failed"** - Check gas and network

## 📊 What's Fixed

### Before:
- ❌ Transactions executed but UI didn't update
- ❌ Required page refresh to see changes
- ❌ Missing environment variables
- ❌ Incomplete contract integration

### After:
- ✅ Transactions execute and UI updates automatically
- ✅ Smooth data refresh without page reloads
- ✅ Proper environment configuration
- ✅ Complete contract integration with all functions
- ✅ Real-time data updates
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** - Try all functions (deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw)
2. **Verify data accuracy** - Ensure all calculations are correct
3. **Add more features** - Interest accrual, notifications, etc.
4. **Deploy to production** - When ready for mainnet

The contract-UI wiring is now properly connected and should work seamlessly! 🎉
